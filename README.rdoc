Q. What if additional types of users were introduced into the product?  What if additional layers of permissions were required?  
A. I would use Devise and CanCan to deal with login users and login user roles.

Q. What sorts of validations would you want?
A. Email and phone number format validation, of course!

Other notes: I wrote this all from scratch. If I were doing this for real, I wouldv'e used a combination of Devise, CanCan, and ActiveAdmin to make a decent looking admin, with authorization, and user roles. I would have also written tests (I stubbed out the things I would test for but did not fill them in as I ran out of time)
